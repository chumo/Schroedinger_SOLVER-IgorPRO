# Schroedinger_SOLVER-IgorPRO

Schroedinger_SOLVER is an Igor Pro procedure (written in Igor 6.3) that 
integrates numerically the Schroedinger equation with the NUMEROV method to obtain 
the time-independent -or stationary- solutions, for any given 1-D potential.

The solver assumes boundary conditions in which the wave function is zero 
at both extremes of the space domain (coordinate x). 

To run the code in Igor Pro, simply **Open File > Procedure** from the menu **File**, select
*Schroedinger_SOLVER.ipf* and then go to menu **Macros > Schroedinger Solver**. The main panel will appear after 
compilation.

The procedure is freeware in the hope that it can be helpful for educational
purposes, but without any warranty. I would be thankful for any suggestion,
comment or bug fixing that could improve this code.
